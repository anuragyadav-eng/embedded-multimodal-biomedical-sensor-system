Electrooculography (EOG) is utilized to measure eye movements by detecting the potential difference generated by the corneo-retinal dipole of the human eye.

This module documents:
- Principles of horizontal and vertical eye movement detection
- Electrode placement around the eyes for accurate signal acquisition
- Signal amplification and filtering requirements
- Methods for reducing noise and motion-related artifacts
