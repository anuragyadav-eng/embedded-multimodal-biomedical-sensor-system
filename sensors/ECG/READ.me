Electrocardiography (ECG) is utilized to acquire and analyze the electrical activity of the heart through surface electrodes placed on the body.

This module documents:
- Fundamental ECG waveform components, including P wave, QRS complex, and T wave
- Standard electrode placement configurations for reliable signal acquisition
- Analog signal conditioning, including amplification and band-limiting filters
- Techniques for minimizing motion artifacts and power-line interference
