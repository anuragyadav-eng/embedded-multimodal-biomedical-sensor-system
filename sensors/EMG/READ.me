Electromyography (EMG) is employed to measure the electrical activity generated by skeletal muscles during contraction and relaxation.

This module documents:
- Characteristics of surface EMG signals and their frequency range
- Standard electrode placement over targeted muscle groups
- High-gain amplification and signal conditioning requirements
- Techniques for reducing motion artifacts and electromagnetic interference
