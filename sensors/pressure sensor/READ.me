The force/pressure sensor is used to measure applied mechanical force or pressure exerted on a surface and convert it into a corresponding electrical signal.

This module documents:
- Operating principle of the force/pressure sensing element
- Interface circuitry and signal conditioning requirements
- Calibration methodology for accurate force measurement
- Applications in biomechanical and human–machine interaction systems
