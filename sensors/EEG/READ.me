Electroencephalography (EEG) is employed to record the electrical activity of the brain through non-invasive scalp electrodes, capturing neural signals with low amplitude and low frequency characteristics.

This module documents:
- Fundamental characteristics of EEG signals and their frequency bands
- Electrode placement considerations for scalp-based measurements
- High-gain amplification and low-noise signal conditioning requirements
- Techniques for minimizing artifacts caused by motion, muscle activity, and external interference
