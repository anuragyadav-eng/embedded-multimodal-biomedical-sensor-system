Electrodermal Activity (EDA) is used to measure variations in skin conductance caused by changes in sweat gland activity, which are influenced by the autonomic nervous system.

This module documents:
- Fundamental principles of EDA signal acquisition
- Electrode placement on the skin for reliable measurements
- Low-frequency signal conditioning and amplification requirements
- Common sources of noise and methods for improving signal stability
