# Safety and Disclaimer

## Electrical Safety
All circuits used in this project operate at low voltages suitable for
educational laboratory use. Care has been taken to minimize electrical risk;
however, proper isolation techniques must always be followed when interfacing
any electronic system with the human body.

The system must be powered only from battery sources or properly isolated
power supplies. Direct connection to mains power is strictly prohibited.

## Human Subject Safety
Signals recorded using this system are limited to non-invasive surface
measurements. Electrodes and sensors should be placed according to basic
safety guidelines, and the system should never be used on individuals with
known medical conditions without professional supervision.

This project is intended for controlled experimental and educational
environments only.

## Data Privacy and Ethics
No personal, identifiable, or sensitive medical data is collected, stored,
or shared as part of this project. Any recorded signals are anonymized and
used solely for demonstration and learning purposes.

The project follows basic ethical principles for biomedical experimentation
and avoids any form of clinical interpretation.

## Disclaimer
This project is developed strictly for educational and research purposes.
It is not a certified medical device and must not be used for diagnosis,
treatment, monitoring, or clinical decision-making.

The authors assume no responsibility for misuse of the system or for any
outcomes resulting from its application outside the intended scope.
