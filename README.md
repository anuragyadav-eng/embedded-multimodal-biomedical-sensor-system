# Embedded Multimodal Biomechanical Sensor System

## Overview
This project focuses on designing and developing an embedded system capable of acquiring multiple biomechanical and biomedical signals in real time.

- EEG (Electroencephalography)
- ECG (Electrocardiography)
- EMG (Electromyography)
- EOG (Electrooculography)
- EDA (Electrodermal Activity)
- Force/Pressure Sensor

## Objective
To build a low-cost, modular embedded platform for biosignal acquisition and processing.
