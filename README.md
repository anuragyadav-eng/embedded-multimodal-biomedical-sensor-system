# Project Overview

## Title
Multimodal Biomedical Sensor System for Physiological Signal Acquisition

## Introduction
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a multimodal biomedical
sensor system capable of acquiring and analyzing multiple physiological signals.
The system integrates six different sensors to capture electrical, electrochemical,
and biomechanical signals from the human body.

The primary objective is to develop an educational and research-oriented platform
that demonstrates real-world challenges involved in biomedical signal acquisition,
such as low signal amplitude, noise, motion artifacts, and signal conditioning.

## Sensors Integrated
The system includes the following sensors:

- Electroencephalography (EEG): Brain electrical activity
- Electrocardiography (ECG): Heart electrical activity
- Electromyography (EMG): Muscle electrical activity
- Electrooculography (EOG): Eye movement signals
- Electrodermal Activity (EDA): Skin conductance changes
- Force / Pressure Sensor: Mechanical force and pressure measurement

## System Architecture
Each sensor captures a weak physiological signal that is first processed by an
analog front-end circuit. Signal conditioning includes amplification, filtering,
and noise reduction before the signal is digitized using an Analog-to-Digital
Converter (ADC). The digital data is then processed by an embedded system and
visualized or stored for further analysis.

## Current Project Status
